 * Configuration for the in-memory, per-instance rate limiter used on public auth endpoints
 * (login, register, portal login). Backed by bucket4j token buckets held in a ConcurrentHashMap.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: this is intentionally in-memory and per-JVM-instance. It is adequate for a single API
 * instance. If the API is ever scaled horizontally (multiple instances behind a load balancer),
 * this must be replaced with a shared/distributed bucket store (e.g. bucket4j-redis) so limits
 * are enforced consistently across instances.
